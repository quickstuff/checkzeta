# Quickly check the [Riemann Zeta Function of a Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function)

# Usage
* Get the latest python (preinstalled in most Unix/Linux)
* Open the terminal and cd to downloads: `cd Downloads`
* Then enter the following `python3 zeta_of_s.py`

# Things to remember
* In python, the imaginary number can be used with j (<coefficient>i = <coefficient>j)
* Maths module is already imported, so you can do stuff like -- s = sqrt(2); s = 2**100
